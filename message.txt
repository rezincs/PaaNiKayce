# To Kayce,

Hi Kayce, So this website is what I've been working on and coding these past few days and this website would serve as my appreciation letter. Parang long appreciation message pero may extra steps HAHAHAH (HINDI KASI SAPAT KUNG SA IG NAGLOLONG MESSAGE). Although I am still not the best at JavaScript I did my best and did a lot of searching just for you. And to start, I hope the song Somebody's Pleasure is starting, because I know you love that song and I'd expand on that later on (HINAAN MO NALANG KUNG MALAKAS WHAHAHLKRFHAHDAWDHAW), you are probably reading this after we watched La La Land and I hope we had fun watching that movie. (I hope we do watch it and it doesn't get cancelled huhu) From what I've heard, that movie was traumatic so I hope this letter would bring a bit of comfort and joy instead.

Do you know why I chose La La Land ba? Well I specifically chose that movie not because we both haven't watched it but I wanted to make you feel how I felt when we met, that movie was pretty traumatic and sad and you felt empty after watching, and while reading this letter, you might be feeling appreciated, relief, peace, and warmth. That is the exact representation of how I felt when I met you. It started in me being empty and sad because of past traumas and when we decided to play therapy, a simple game for people to talk to, I met you. And when we talked and had our first deep conversation and appreciation, I FELT REASSURED, APPRECIATED, AND AT PEACE. I WAS SO HAPPY (EVEN NOW) BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A WONDERFUL PERSON OH MY GOD. So that's why I chose that movie La La Land lol. I am currently writing this at September 5, 2024 when I told you that I was going to do school work but actually I am writing this instead.

What I admire most about you is your sense of humor muna. Every time we play Roblox, your jokes genuinely make me happy until now. Ngayon nga sa chats puro ka yappuchino nakakainis T_T HAHALWHADAHW anyways, every time we talk we always laugh and be happy, even though we have our own problems, a simple dip in our conversation would even make the saddest person on earth feel ecstasy. I told you that I'm starting to listen to Zild and every song just reminds me of you, especially "Medisina" because it talks about how your soul is literally like a disguised angel that heals anyone. Your soul is PROBABLY an angel that heals everyone around you. There’s something so pure and uplifting about your presence. Whenever I’m feeling down or overwhelmed, just being with you feels like a balm for the heart. You have this incredible ability to bring peace and light to even the darkest moments, and I’m in awe of how effortlessly you do it. You make people feel seen, understood, and valued, and that’s a gift not everyone has.

And even though you do have those qualities, I don't see you as just a remedy for my own pleasure and struggles. YOU'RE SOOOO MUCH MORE THAN THAT. You're a true friend I truly value as a person, your angelic personality, your humor, and the way your presence makes anything better, and how pure your soul is, I truly appreciate that. You’re not just someone who helps me feel better when things are tough; I appreciate you for all the moments we share, whether we’re laughing, suddenly in a deep convo, or just talking. Our friendship isn’t just about what you do for me, it’s about who you are, and I wouldn’t trade that for anything.

I hope after watching that movie and after talking about it would be one of our favorite moments this September. Actually, nung isang araw na puro tayo tawanan already made my September. BECAUSE GIRL GRABE, EVERY MOMENT WITH YOU IS THE BEST. And even though it's only been two months, I appreciate our bond na mas lumakas and how we even got closer and became more open to each other. I also notice na... I don't hate any qualities you have. I love everything about you, I LOVE HOW YOU TELL ME YOUR DAY SA SCHOOL, I LOVE HOW YOU TELL ME AN EPISODE YOU WATCHED. KANINA NUNG NANOOD KA FRUITS BASKET YOU EVEN EXPLAINED TO ME HOW YOU ALMOST CRIED DAHIL SA SINABI NI MOMIJI. HUHU I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU SO MUCH I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THIS IS ENOUGH TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH YOU MEAN TO ME. Siguro if you can read my mind malalaman mo truly how much I appreciate you. IF YOU CAN READY MY MIND YOU'D KNOW HOW SPECIAL YOU ARE, WHICH IS WHY I'M DOING MY BEST TO SHOW ACTIONS KUNG ANO PINAPAKITA NG MIND KO. Siguro nga kung nagpopost ako ng august dump july dump puro roblox natin LOL. Again thank you for being such a wonderful friend. I've enjoyed EVERY SINGLE moment with you baka nga paulit ulit na ako rito but I can't wait to make more memories with you moving forward. Siguro without you, I would still be in the state of emptiness like you felt after watching that movie.

And to end this message, I want you to know and be reassured that I will always be here for you no matter what you do. I would correct you if you did something wrong, help you when you have a bad day, and be there for you every step of the way. You deserve all the happiness in the world, and I would do everything just to see you smile. I hope that when you receive this message, you finally feel relived since you finished your screening sa featured hosts. I wil pray for you that you get results that you want and what God plans for you. I also see that you love Somebody's Pleasure by Aziz and how you relate to the song. I was actually saddened na nagrerelate ka since you shouldn't be. YOU'RE WAY TOO GOOD FOR THIS WORLD TO RELATE TO ANY SAD SONGS. The song talks about how happiness is just happiness and it's temporary and you feel empty even though you have a lot of friends. I will give anything and do my best so you don't see that song as something relatable right now, but a song you used to look at because you're a better person now. I also hope that you ordered a yappuchino today HAHAHAHHA. But once again, I truly appreciate you, and I can't wait to spend more time with you. 

You are valued, Kayce. You can do it.
